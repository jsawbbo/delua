# Extended/-sible Lua

"*[Lua](http://www.lua.org) is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting
language. It supports procedural programming,object-oriented programming, functional programming,
data-driven programming, and data description.*

*[Lua](http://www.lua.org) combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative
arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode with a
register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection,
making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.*"

This package is a [cmake](https://cmake.org/)'ified version of plain [Lua](http://www.lua.org) with
some **optional** additions, e.g.
- library compiled for C++
- thread safety
etc.

See cmake's LUA_\* variables for further information.
